    "There is around 2 months of study time remaining for me to complete the EMA.  During that time I also need to learn how to do the datamingin and improve my mongodb skills to the level that I can carry out the analysis effectively.  Basing this plan on 16 hours per week of study time and 8 weeks I have the following plan outline."
