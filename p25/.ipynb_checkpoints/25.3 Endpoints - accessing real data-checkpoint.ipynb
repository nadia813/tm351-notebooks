When you amend a query it is very likely that you will make mistakes. Most query engines are good at providing error messages should you make mistakes in the syntax of a query. However, they vary in the helpfulness of error reporting should a website be unavailable. You may come across error messages such as 'Error 400: Failed to load URL http://dbpedia.org/' which probably means that one of the websites mentioned in a query is unavailable (perhaps because it is being updated).

    "Since the 1970s, the Department for Communities and Local Government has calculated local measures of deprivation in England. The increasing availability of administrative data at local levels has driven developments in the definition and measurement of deprivation. For the 2010 investigation, seven distinct domains have been identified: Income Deprivation, Employment Deprivation, Health Deprivation and Disability, Education Skills and Training Deprivation, Barriers to Housing and Services, Living Environment Deprivation, and Crime. They have been combined, using appropriate weights, into a single overall Index of Multiple Deprivation which can be used to rank every small area in England according to the deprivation experienced by the people living there.\n",

Also, it is to be hoped that the names used for the predicates provide a clue as to their meaning.\n",
