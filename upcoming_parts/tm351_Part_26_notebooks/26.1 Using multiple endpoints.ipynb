    "Since the 1970s, the Department for Communities and Local Government has calculated local measures of deprivation in England. The increasing availability of administrative data at local levels has driven developments in the definition and measurement of deprivation. For the 2010 investigation, seven distinct domains have been identified: Income Deprivation, Employment Deprivation, Health Deprivation and Disability, Education Skills and Training Deprivation, Barriers to Housing and Services, Living Environment Deprivation, and Crime. They have been combined, using appropriate weights, into a single overall Index of Multiple Deprivation which can be used to rank every small area in England according to the deprivation experienced by the people living there.\n",
