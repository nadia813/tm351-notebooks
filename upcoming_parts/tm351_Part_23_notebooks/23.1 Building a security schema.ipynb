A superuser can GRANT any of the privileges they have by default, including, for example, CREATEUSER, to any other user; but the detail of managing the full range of privileges is beyond the scope of this module.  It should also be borne in mind that the precise set of privileges associated with users by default is not specified in the SQL standard, so it will vary between different database platforms.\n",
