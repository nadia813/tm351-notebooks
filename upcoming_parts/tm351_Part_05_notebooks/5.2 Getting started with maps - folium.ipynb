    "One of the most powerful - and intuitive - visualisation techniques for location-based data is to make use of maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical subject of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a very broad one, but at its core are systems specifically tailored for the storage, display, interrogation and management of geographic, location-related data. The common feature of all GIS is the central role that location plays in the data - acting as a key to draw together data from different sources and forming the main relationship between data elements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Latitiude and longitude values can be used to determine a point on the Earth's surface, but these are not the only coordinate systems that could be used.  There is also the problem that the Earth's spherical representation makes it difficult to accurately represent both area and shape when working on a flat surface (screen or paper).  For this reason different projections are available that convert the spherical reality of the Earth's surfce to the flat representation of our screens and atlases and, similar to choosing an appropriate visualisation for graphic data, choosing a suitable projection for mapping data can be important.  So, simply plotting the latitude and longitude position on a grid is not sufficient: a mathematical transformation to the chosen projection is required.  These and other complex issues (handling height above sea level, mapping areas as well as points) are concerns in mapping and GIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introduction we're going to take a GIS-lite approach to maps.  We're going to use a library that has a single projection, and uses 'raw' latitude and longitude values for points on the map. We're also using maps to support the visualisation of data (rather than for capturing data), so we're interested in how to present data on the maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically three - or four, depending how you count them - ways of representing data on a map:\n",
    "\n",
    "- points, or markers\n",
    "- lines\n",
    "- regions, or shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _fourth_ way is to use proportional symbol markers - that is, markers such as circles whose size is proportional to some quantity relevant to the marker location.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several libraries available that can help us work with maps. One approach is to generate base maps using graphic visualisation libraries such as matplotlib to form quick, static sketch maps. If we require interactive JavaScript style maps, we can use the mplleaflet library to convert these static map representations to embedded interactive ones using the leaflet JavaScript library. Another is to use a package such as *folium* to create a leaflet map directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at ways of representing location data with the _folium_ package, which integrates Python and _pandas_ data handling interactive, leaflet JavaScript, maps.  folium handles a lot of the underying details, letting us get on with presenting our location-based data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of a package like folium is a compromise between the full power of the packages it uses and the flexibility and complexity of the features you can use in the full leaflet library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We won't be working directly with leaflet or matplotlib maps in this module."

It is not until the HTML is used to display the map that the tile set is retrieved.  This keeps the map files small, but means you cannot display a map if your are offline.    A network connection is required to retrieve the map tiles, so if you are not connected to the internet you cannot display the map in the HTML document.\n",

    "Lines, or more usually sequences of connected lines, are sometimes useful on a map.  For example, tracing a route from location to location or connecting related points can be shown with lines. folium simply takes a list of coordinates and plots a straight line between them. Pop-up text is also permitted on folium lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are limitations to using straight lines on maps - they can be misleading.  \n",
    "As a 2-dimensional (flat) map represents a projection from the 3-dimensional surface of the Earth, there will be some distortion depending on which projection is chosen.  The result will be that, for example, two lines of the same visible length may represent different distances depending on their being near the poles or the equator, or when used parallel to latitude or longitude great circles.  Also, as the scale increases the distortion due to the curve of the Earth may becomes more noticable, resulting in lines that clearly don't follow the great circles (airline routes shouldn't look as if they take the straightest/shortest/most direct route when shown on most 2D projections, as on the surface of the Earth the shortest distance is a 3D curve, for example).  We won't be looking at how to adapt our maps for these distortions - but don't forget these limitations if you explore GIS systems further."

When I'd picked the data I wanted, I used the _format_ tab to select KML format for the output file.  Once I'd downloaded the output file I needed to convert the KML to GeoJSON.\n",

A quick check with OpenRefine (open the file as a JSON format file) shows this parsed correctly, and allowed me to look for the property name used for the Districts - in this case `properties.Name`.\n",

Next time it'll take less than 5 minutes if the repository contains the boundary data I need.\n",
