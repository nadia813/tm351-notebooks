    "\n",
    "As you will have observed, the spreadsheet provided by ONS contains values alone: no formulas are provided. To discover how summary data has been calculated you have to examine the notes provided by ONS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each table has meaningful labels for its columns and rows. There are a variety of notes to accompany each table and figure to help you understand the data presented. Even then, with this information it is not always easy to understand precisely what the data represents: in Table 1, what is the difference, if any, between robbery and theft, for example?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, ONS provides a wealth of additional information on its website. If you move to the first sheet, labelled *Notes*, there is a link to a set of explanatory notes for the statistics in this spreadsheet. There you will find that a robbery is an incident or offence in which force or the threat of force is used either during or immediately prior to a theft or attempted theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, you need to become expert in the categorisation of offences in order to fully appreciate the data you are viewing."

    "5.\tWhen clicked on, the value in a cell is displayed in the formula bar ready for editing.\n",

    "8.\tThat an address given in terms of a specific column letter and row number is a relative address. Relative addresses are adjusted automatically as necessary whenever rows or columns are inserted or deleted. \n",
    "9.\tThat references to a specific cell or range of cells that must not be automatically adjusted use absolute addresses in which either a column letter and/or a row number is preceded by a dollar sign, e.g. `$B$2`.\n",
