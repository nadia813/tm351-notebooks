    "This Notebook will focus on the use of visualisation in the reporting stage of the analysis pipeline.  In the main text I made the distinction between the analyst's exploratory use of graphics (showing the datasets and identifying interesting issues for further analysis) and the explanatory nature of the reporting visualisations that aim to focus attention on the findings of the analysis.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are assuming that the analysis is complete; we have our findings and we want to communicate those effectively, preferably to have the graphic we produce tell part of the stories of our data, the analysis results and our findings.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In Notebook `04.3 Simple Visualisations in pandas` we used the _pandas_ `plot()` method to draw some basic graphics and we used some features of the _matplotlib.pyplot_ library to add some enhancements to those basic graphics.   Our purpose there was to allow the raw data to be presented to identify areas of interest for exploration during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't be developing reader-driven stories in our visualisations - the focus here will be on reporting our findings, so we will aim to produce explanatory, author-driven visualisations using one or more static charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the worked example that is the main focus of this Notebook, there are also two additional, optional examples.  These show how visualisations similar to two that appear in main text can be  built.   They are based on the Medi-care graphic (Figure 5.5) and the life expectancy v. GDP graphic (Figure 5.15) in Part 5 of the module.   These worked examples follow the _What next?_ section below."

    "_matplotlib_ is a Python 2D plotting library which produces good quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, web application servers, and various graphical user interface toolkits.  matplotlib.pyplot provides simple plotting facilities tailored to the IPython environment.  \n",

    "The _pandas_ `plot()` mothod is a wrapper allowing simple combinations of the `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()` and _pandas_ data strutures.  It's a good starting point for generating the basic chart, to which additional pyplot features can be applied. Working directly from matplotlib offers the greatest control of the chart elements.\n",

    "We only cover a limited number of features of matplotlib and _pandas_ `plot()` in this Notebook.  Additional documentation can be found at http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html for _pandas_, and http://matplotlib.org/1.5.0/api/pyplot_summary.html for `.pyplot`."

    "Heathrow Airport, on the outskirts of London, is a busy international airport. It opened a major new terminal building in March 2008. Like most major airports it suffers from some big disruptions on occasions (bad winter weather, terrorists, etc.).  Heathrow is being considered for a new runway to increase its capacity.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The monthly data for Heathrow is available, from January 2005, showing passenger numbers, air transport movements, and metric tonnes of cargo for each month (although we are not interested specifically in the cargo, it was interesting to see the data).  \n",
    "\n",
    "I looked at this data to see how Heathrow activity was growing; had the new terminal increased passenger numbers and was there evidence that flight or passenger numbers had reached a peak supporting the argument that it required a new runway?  There was also a second investigation which was to identify the impact of some major disruptions on Heathrow activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the monthly data spreadsheet has a second sheet which contains details of the passenger markets (in terms of flight origin or destination by passenger numbers) broken down into seven regions. I did not use this in the following example."

So we want to show data from the same month together.\n",
