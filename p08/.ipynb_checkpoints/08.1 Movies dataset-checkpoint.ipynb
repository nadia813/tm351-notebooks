The queries are motivated by a question we want to know the answer to. This should then help us tell (or find) a particular story, and so provide us with information that might help us make a particular decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query itself may be made up of several distinct processing steps, such as aggregation and sorting, and may require data from several sources to be combined. If you are to work effectively with data, you need to develop a range of skills. In the first case, you need to be able to generate interesting questions that can be reasonably asked of the data - that is, you need to think like an *investigator*; secondly, you need to be able to transform those questions into queries, or processing steps, that can be applied to the data at hand - a *programming* step; thirdly, you need to be able to implement the query, for example by writing some *python*/*pandas* code or an SQL query that manipulates the data contained in a *pandas* `DataFrame` or a relational database - a *coding* step. This final step may also require you to do some prior work, such cleaning (or *clean__s__ing*) it to get it into a state were you can reliably write the queries which will enable you to ask the right questions of it.\n",
