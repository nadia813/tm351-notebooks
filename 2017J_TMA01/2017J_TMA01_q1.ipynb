    "### 1. Is the provenance of the data made clear?\n",
    "The data is published by _DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs)_.  As a government agency it should be a good source of data.  However, the description states that the prices are the average of \"the most usual prices\" from a variety of wholesalers.  However, this description does allow a certain amount of ambiguity as how do they determine the most usual price, and it isn't clear if they go to every wholesaler in those locations or just a small sample.  So although the publisher is clearly identified the source is not quite so clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Is it clear when the data was last updated?\n",
    "It is not clear when the data was last updated as there is no record of that information on the website. There is a quality check date given as 17/12/17, but that is just ensuring the csv format is ok.  You could make an assumption that it was last updated in 2015 as that is when the dataset ends, but assumptions are not concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What can you infer from your answers to these questions about the completeness and reliability of the data?\n",
    "Clearly these two questions have exposed that we cannot have complete faith in the completeness or reliability of this data.  The locations of the wholesalers are listed, but on a city wide level, leaving us unsure whether they refer to the city or just the market.  We can not be sure the data is complete or whether it has it is reliable.\n",
