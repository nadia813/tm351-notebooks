Even then, with this information it is not always easy to understand precisely what the data represents: in Table 1, what is the difference, if any, between robbery and theft, for example?\n",

    "Fortunately, ONS provides a wealth of additional information on its website. If you move to the first sheet, labelled *Notes*, there is a link to a set of explanatory notes for the statistics in this spreadsheet. There you will find that a robbery is an incident or offence in which force or the threat of force is used either during or immediately prior to a theft or attempted theft.\n",
