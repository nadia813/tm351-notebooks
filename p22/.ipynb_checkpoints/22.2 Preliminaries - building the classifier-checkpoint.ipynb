Be aware that in these Notebooks we are *not* attempting to make the code as efficient as possible. Rather, we are aiming to show how an intuitively simple algorithm, such as *k*-NN, can be used to deliver good results on a practical, real-world application. If you were to try to use these techniques on a genuinely large dataset (such as on all the email sent and received by a large corporation in a typical day), you would expect to need a significant amount of time exploring techniques to optimise your implementations of the algorithms (or, of course, to use an off-the-shelf implementation).
